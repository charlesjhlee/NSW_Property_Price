# NSW_Property_Price
NSW property sales data extraction using html parsing

This is a python code that I coded in order to download all publicly available property sales transactions found on the NSW Globe website in csv format.

The data gets downloaded into a single csv file around 180MB.

DISCLAIMER: Please note that I have merely combined publicly available csv files into a single csv file. I have not used this data to profit in any way.
